### JitterBug

This sketch is inspired by PacMan and the "tickle" demo from the p5.js web editor. The first goal of the sketch was to explore random jitter motion within a bounded canvas. The second was to pull from the PacMan game environment to evoke a well-known "chase experience". Further extending this piece would incorporate PacMan sound effects and other objects for JitterBug to chase on the gray screen.
